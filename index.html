                        State-owned bank State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to extend the repayment timelines for the automobile dealers by 15 to 30 days, give them more space and time to repay their loan without a penalty. This decision has come up amid slowing car sales continuously for the last nine months.
                        P.K. Gupta, Managing Director (retail and digital banking), SBI said, "Normally, the repayment period is 60 days. So we extend it for 75 days for some dealers and to 90 days for a few others."
                        The auto dealers owe more than Rs 11,000 crore to the bank.

                                        The very opening scene of Chhichhore with a bunch of engineering hostel students engaged in a 'tub fight' in the middle of the night is enough to tell you that you're in for a fun ride. The tragedy hits within the first 20 minutes of the film but kudos to director Nitesh Tiwari for striking the perfect balance while oscillating between the present unfortunate situation and the memoirs of the past hostel/college life. It's evident that the film is a heartfelt tribute of the helmer to the days he spent in the campus of IIT Bombay as a student. 
                                        Though, the film does seem to have a hangover

                                        Google formally offered its solutions to avoid more EU mega-fines Wednesday, after Brussels accused the US tech giant of illegally abusing the dominance of its Android operating system for mobile devices.
                                        
                                        The European Commission in July hit Google with its biggest ever fine, imposing a 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) penalty, giving the US tech giant 90 days to change its practices.
                                        
                                        Brussels accused Google of using the Android system's dominance of smartphones and tablets to promote the use of its own Google search engine and shut out rivals. Google has appealed the decision, arguing that the EU's accusations were unfounded, but on Wednesday said it would comply with the decision in order to avoid further fines.

                                        US President Donald Trump on Friday posted on Twitter a photo of what appeared to be the site of a failed Iranian satellite launch, raising questions about whether he had disclosed US surveillance secrets.
                                        The black-and-white photo showed the fire-blasted launch site at a space center in northern Iran including a damaged gantry service tower and a downed mobile erector launcher.
                                        Trump, in his tweet, cited the specific location of the site, saying the United States was not involved in the "catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran."

                                <a>The fifth earth-bound orbit-raising manoeuvres of the Chandrayaan 2 spacecraft has been successfully completed Tuesday afternoon, as planned, the Indian Space Research Organisation confirmed in a tweet.
                                        The manoeuvre was carried out at 3.04 pm IST using the onboard propulsion system for a firing duration of 1041 seconds (~17 minutes), four days after the fourth orbit-raising was completed, placing the spacecraft -in a 276 x 142975 km orbit (nearest x furthest Earth-bound altitude), according to ISRO. The final orbit achieved by the Chandrayaan 2 spacecraft after the fourth orbit-raising is  277 x 89472 km.
                                        ISRO also reported that all the spacecraft parameters were normal. The next step will be the Trans Lunar Insertion (TLI) that is scheduled for the afternoon of 14 August at 3.00 pm - 4.00 pm IST.
                                        The TLI is a manoeuvre of thrusts used to set the spacecraft on the moon-bound path. After this, the Chandrayaan 2 composite will take less than a week to arrive in the proximity of the moon. This manoeuver will place the spacecraft on a 266 x 4,13,623 orbit that will end in the next stage of the mission: lunar transfer.

Google has appealed the decision, arguing that the EU's accusations were unfounded, but on Wednesday said it would comply with the decision in order to avoid further fines.
